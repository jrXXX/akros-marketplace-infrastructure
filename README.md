# Installing and Running the Infrastructure


## Database only

For Java-Backend-Developers start only the PostGreSQL database to develop the Rest Services.

Use **database_only** folder configuration.


## Rest-Services

For Frontend-Developers start the the PostGreSQL database and the Rest Services to develop the frontend functionality.

Use **restservice** folder configuration.


### Folder

- **db_init** : Folder is used for initialization of the database.
- **pg_data** : Folder will be created when starting the database. All database data persists in this folder, so no data loss between restart of the database.
